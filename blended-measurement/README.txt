This directory contains a separate paper on Level 2 object
characterization (WBS 02C.04.06).  It should ultimately be merged with
the main text of LDM-151, but it's currently at a much higher level of
detail, and it has an organizational structure that'd be hard to
integrate into the LDM-151 text as it currently stands.
